### Theory
Orifice is an opening or a hole of any size, shape or form through which liquid flow such that its upper edge remains below the free surface of the liquid. Orifices are used for measurement of control of flow. Orifices may have any shape but generally they are circular, square or rectangular.

When a liquid flows from a vessel or a tank, through an orifice it changes its direction. Due to this change of direction of the liquid, the jet is acted upon by lateral or side forces, which gradually reduce its area up to certain section. This area does not reduce further beyond, which the jet ceases and streamlines, first become parallel is known as the vena contracta.
