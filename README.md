### About the Experiment 

The experiment you are referring to is likely an Orifice and Free Jet Flow experiment. In this experiment, the coefficients of velocity and discharge are determined by measuring the trajectory of a jet issuing fluid from an orifice in the side of a reservoir under steady flow conditions, i.e., a constant reservoir head
